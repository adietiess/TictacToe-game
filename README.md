You can see how the game's strategy is used in this Tic-Tac-Toe game. In this game, two players compete against each other. You have a single print board on the screen that shows numbers from 1 to 9, or box numbers. Selecting X or O for the particular box number is now required. For instance, if you have to choose any number, the print board will display X or O, and the turn for the next will be there. The assignment is to write a Java programme that will enable two players to play a 3x3 game of Tic Tac Toe.
